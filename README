SSL Requirement
===============

SSL requirement adds a declarative way of specifying that certain actions should
only be allowed to run under SSL, and if they're accessed without it, they should
be redirected.

The methods are: account_url, account_host, and account_domain.

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SslRequirement
  end

  class AccountController < ApplicationController
    ssl_required :signup, :payment
    
    def signup
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end
    
    def payment
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end
  end
  
You can overwrite the protected method ssl_required? to rely on other things than
just the declarative specification. Say, only premium accounts get SSL.

P.S.: Beware when you include the SslRequirement module. At the time of inclusion,
it'll add the before_filter that validates the declarations. Some times you'll want to
run other before_filters before that. They should then be declared ahead of including
this module.
